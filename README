This is my fishing application for Professor Greenwell's Software Project Comp Networks course.

The app is designed to store a history of fishing events, and using this persisting data, calculate the best place to fish on any given day.

Report screen is used to submit your fishing sessions into the database.

Enter current conditions in the forecast screen to use your past fishing to tell you the best spot to fish.

History shows the history of your submissions

Good luck fishing!
